            <strong>2019</strong> just steps away from Vancouver’s famous seawall.
            We specialise in making it easy and comfortable for everyone—from first-time
            riders to seasoned cyclists—to explore <em>Stanley Park</em> and the
            waterfront on two wheels.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our team is known for warm, friendly service and clear advice. Whether you’re
            visiting Vancouver for the first time or planning a regular weekend ride,
            we’ll help you choose the right bike, explain the route, and make sure
            you feel confident before you roll out.

            <h2>Where we started</h2>

            <p>
                Coal Harbour Bike Rental opened its doors in <strong>2019</strong> with
                a simple idea: give people an easy way to experience Vancouver’s seawall
                and city views without worrying about equipment or planning.
            </p>

            <p>
                We’re a small, owner-operated shop located at
                <strong>1570 Coal Harbour Quay, Vancouver, BC V6G&nbsp;3E9</strong>,
                a short ride from the entrance to <em>Stanley Park</em>. Every bike and
                scooter is tuned daily so your ride feels smooth, safe, and fun.
            </p>
